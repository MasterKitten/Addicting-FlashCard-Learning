When you contribute, the changes won't be seen immediately.

The reviewer would check to see if it is ok to be merged.

Once ok, it will be merged. Merges could be denied for the following reasons:

## 1. The changes are not what they are said they are.

## 2. They don't improve the app in a meaningful way
